            <p class="description">
              Invented 15 different appliances for the electric railways and
              held nearly 60 patents at the time of his death. He was most known
              for inventing the multiplex "induction telegraph," which allowed
              for voice communication through telegraph wires. The device ended
              up preventing many train accidents. Thomas Edison tried to sue
              Woods after he invented the multiplex telegraph. The lawsuit
              failed, so Edison tried to make Woods a partner, but he refused.

            <p class="description">
              She was one of only two women in her class to major in physics.
              She excelled at school and landed a job as a mathematical/data
              analyst for NASA. She worked at NASA from 1964 to 1995, conducting
              large-scale experiments, developing computer data systems, and
              most notably, spearheading the development of the first satellite
              to send images from space, "Landsat." The technology she developed
              is still used by NASA today.

              Annie J Easley was a NASA scientist. When she began her career,
              she was only one of four Black employees out of 2,500 employees.
              Her most famous work was on the Centaur rocket, a
              first-of-its-kind rocket that used a unique fuel system. Its
              legacy still endures today. She had a long career with NASA,
              working on extremely advanced technology while overcoming Jim Crow
              laws and discrimination.

            <p class="description">
              Often referred to as the "Godfather of Silicon Valley." After
              graduating from Saint Louis University in the 50's (where he was
              one of the first Black men to attend), he started working in
              computer programming. With one computer taking up an entire room,
              he lead the team that engineered HP's entrance into the computer
              market. In 2003, he was inducted into the Silicon Valley
              Engineering Council's Hall of Fame.

              Second African-American woman ever to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics
              (hers was from Yale). After working in D.C. using math to help
              develop missile fuses, Granville took on a role at IBM in 1956.
              Later on, she worked at NASA designing computer software that
              helped analyze satellite orbits. She also worked on the Apollo
              program in 1962 before returning to IBM as a senior mathematician.

              Co-invented the foil electret microphone in 1962. Ninety percent
              of the two billion microphones produced annually and used in
              everyday items such as telephones, hearing aids, camcorders, and
              multimedia computers employ electret technology.

              computer-memory systems at Fairchild Semiconductor R&D Labs in the
              1960s. He started two technology companies and later founded
              NewVista Capital, a venture firm with a special focus on minority-
